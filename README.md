This project is just an educational experiment in topic of field-oriented PMSM motor control

things to do:
-tune control loops
-test whether position control works at all or not
-add field weakening
-add overmodulation support
-add ADC simulation
-add hall sensor-based position sensing simulation
-add PWM pattern check & generate only measurable PWM patterns
-refactor the whole codebase into maintainable object structure
-port to an actual target (hoverboard, electric scooter, etc.)
